# Online-Book-Library
My project is a database of a hypothetical ‘Online Book Library’ and I dedicate this project to my fellow book-readers. This database can be used to keep track of authors, publishers, books, readers, and issue information and demonstrate the relationships between them. The project will be written using MySQL and will also include Entity -Relationship schematic diagrams.
